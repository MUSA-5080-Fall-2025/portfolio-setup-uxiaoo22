# Assignment Overview

## Scenario

You are a data analyst for the **Michigan Department of Human Services**. The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.

Drawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis
- Evaluate data quality using margins of error 
- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making
- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues
- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders

## Submission Instructions

**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`

Make sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an "Assignments" menu.

# Part 1: Portfolio Integration

Create this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:

```
- text: Assignments
  menu:
    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd
      text: "Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration"
```
If there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text

# Setup

```{r setup}
# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
# Set your Census API key
census_api_key("eeb46a4e68d059982c2b048f843063e19bc4c294")
# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state
my_state <- "MI"
```

**State Selection:** I have chosen **[Michigan]** for this analysis because: I explicitly did not select Pennsylvania, as I am a PA resident and wish to play with other census data. Michigan was the first state to come to mind. 

# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment

## 2.1 Data Retrieval

**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.

**Requirements:**
- Geography: county level
- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  
- Year: 2022
- Survey: acs5
- Output format: wide

**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = "code")` syntax.

```{r county-data}
# Write your get_acs() code here
county_data_2022 <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
                         state = "MI",
                         variables = c(med_household_income = "B19013_001", total_pop = "B01003_001" ),
                         year = 2022,
                         survey = "acs5",
                         output = "wide")
                         

# Clean the county names to remove state name and "County" 
county_data_2022 <- county_data_2022 %>%
  mutate(county_data_2022_clean = str_remove(NAME,paste0("County, Michigan")))
# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()

# Display the first few rows
head(county_data_2022)
```

## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100
- Create reliability categories:
  - High Confidence: MOE < 5%
  - Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%  
  - Low Confidence: MOE > 10%
- Create a flag for unreliable estimates (MOE > 10%)

**Hint:** Use `mutate()` with `case_when()` for the categories.

```{r income-reliability}
# Calculate MOE percentage and reliability categories using mutate()
MI_county_reliablility <- county_data_2022 %>%
  mutate(
    med_income_moe_pct = (med_household_incomeM / med_household_incomeE) * 100,
    med_income_confi = case_when(
      med_income_moe_pct < 5 ~ "High Confidence (<5%)",
      med_income_moe_pct > 5 & med_income_moe_pct <10 ~ "Moderate Confidence (5% - 10%)",
      med_income_moe_pct > 10  ~ "Low Confidence (>10%)"
    )
  )
# Create a summary showing count of counties in each reliability category
MI_reability_data <- MI_county_reliablility %>%
  count(med_income_confi)%>%
  mutate(percentage = round(n/sum(n)*100, 2))

kable(MI_reability_data,
      caption = "**MI Reliability Summary**",
      align = c("l", "c", "r"),
      digits = 2,
      row.names = TRUE,
      col.names = c("Confidence", "Count", "Percentage")
)
# Hint: use count() and mutate() to add percentages
```

## 2.3 High Uncertainty Counties

**Your Task:** Identify the 5 counties with the highest MOE percentages.

**Requirements:**
- Sort by MOE percentage (highest first)
- Select the top 5 counties
- Display: county name, median income, margin of error, MOE percentage, reliability category
- Format as a professional table using `kable()`

**Hint:** Use `arrange()`, `slice()`, and `select()` functions.

```{r high-uncertainty}
# Create table of top 5 counties by MOE percentage
top5_byMOE <- MI_county_reliablility %>% 
  arrange(desc(med_income_moe_pct))%>% 
  slice(1:5)%>% 
  select(county_data_2022_clean, med_household_incomeE, med_household_incomeM, med_income_moe_pct, med_income_confi) 

kable(top5_byMOE, 
      caption = "**Top 5 Counties by MOE Percentage**", 
      align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "r"),
      digits = 2, 
      row.names = TRUE, 
      col.names = c("County", "Med. Household Income", "Income MOE", "MOE %", "Confidence Intervals"))
  
# Format as table with kable() - include appropriate column names and caption
```

**Data Quality Commentary:**

These are the top 5 counties in Michigan with the highest MOE. Only Keweenaw and Schoolcraft maintain the lowest confidence intervals, probably due to being some of the smallest counties in the state by population (therefore, presumably, little regard is afforded to them and the residents). 

# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis

## 3.1 Focus Area Selection

**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.

**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.

```{r select-counties}
# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data
# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties
selected_counties = top5_byMOE %>%
  filter(med_household_incomeE == 55071 | med_household_incomeE == 47913)

      
# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics
# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category
selected_counties %>%
  select(county_data_2022_clean, med_household_incomeE, med_income_moe_pct, med_income_confi) %>%
  kable(
        caption = "**Schoolcraft and Gogebic County Income Demographics**",
        align = c("l", "c", "c", "r"),
        row.names = TRUE,
        col.names = c("County Name", "Median Income", "MOE (%)", "Reliability Category")
  )
```

**Comment on the output:** Despite Schoolcraft having a higher median income, the MOE surpasses the >10% threshold and therefore falls into the Low Confidence category. 

## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics

**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.

**Requirements:**
- Geography: tract level
- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)
- Use the same state and year as before
- Output format: wide
- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names. Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.

```{r tract-demographics}
# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names
race_vars <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                     survey = "acs5",
                     variables = c(white = "B03002_003", 
                                   black = "B03002_004",
                                   hisp_latinx = "B03002_012",
                                   total_pop = "B03002_001"),
                     year = 2022,
                     state = "MI",
                     county = c("153", "053"), #Schoolcraft is 26153, Gogebic is 26053. 
                     output = "wide"
)
                     
                     
# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data
# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter
# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()
# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations
race_vars_percts = race_vars %>%
  mutate(perct_white = (whiteE/total_popE) * 100,
         perct_black = (blackE/total_popE) * 100,
         perct_latinx = (hisp_latinxE/total_popE) * 100,
         tract_name = str_extract(NAME, "Census Tract \\d+"),
         county_name = str_extract(NAME, "[A-Za-z]+ County" )
  )

# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar MUTATE()& Extract()
  
```

## 3.3 Demographic Analysis

**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.

```{r demographic-analysis}
# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents
# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract
max_latinx <- race_vars_percts %>%
  arrange(desc(perct_latinx))%>%
  slice(1)
kable(max_latinx,
      caption = "HELP", 
      )
# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()
# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group
avg_demo <- race_vars_percts %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  summarize(
    ntracts    = n(),
    white_avg  = mean(perct_white, na.rm = TRUE),
    black_avg  = mean(perct_black, na.rm = TRUE),
    latinx_avg = mean(perct_latinx, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()
kable(avg_demo,
      caption = "Average Demographic Per County",
      align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "r"),
      col.names = c("County Name", "No. of Tracts", "% White", "% Black", "% LatinX"),
      row.names = TRUE
)
```

# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation

## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables

**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable
- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%
- Create summary statistics

```{r demographic-moe}
# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables
# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)
# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable
# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement
moe_gogegic_schoolcraft = race_vars_percts %>%
  mutate(
  MOE_white = (whiteM/whiteE) * 100, 
  MOE_black = (blackM/blackE) * 100,
  MOE_latinx = (hisp_latinxM/hisp_latinxE) * 100,
  MOE_flag = ifelse(MOE_white > 15 | MOE_black > 15 |  MOE_latinx > 15,
  TRUE,
  FALSE
  )
  )
# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues
moe_summary_county <- moe_gogegic_schoolcraft %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  summarize(
    total_tracts    = n(),
    high_MOE_tracts = sum(MOE_flag, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_high_MOE    = round(100 * high_MOE_tracts / total_tracts, 1)
  )

kable (
  moe_summary_county,
  caption = "**MOE Summary**",
  row.names = TRUE,
  col.names = c("County", "Total Tracts", "High MOE Tracts", "Percent High MOE(%)"),
  align = c("l","c","c","r")
)
```

## 4.2 Pattern Analysis

**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.

```{r pattern-analysis}


# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues
# Calculate average characteristics for each group:
# - population size, demographic percentages
moe_patterns <- moe_gogegic_schoolcraft %>%
  group_by(county_name, MOE_flag) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_pop     = mean(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_white   = mean(perct_white, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_black   = mean(perct_black, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_latinx  = mean(perct_latinx, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_tracts    = n()
  )

kable(moe_patterns,
      caption = "**Comparison of High-MOE vs Reliable Tracts**",
      align = c("l", "c", "c", "c","c","c","r"),
      col.names = c("County", "Flag Status", "Population Average", "% White Avg", "% Black Avg", "% LatinX", "Tracts Quantity"),
      digits = 2
)


```

**Pattern Analysis:** Both counties have a population between 2000 - 3000, but Gogebic County has four more tracts available than Schoolcraft. It doesn't seem to matter much because in previous evaluations, demographic results for white estimated, black estimated, and latinx estimated were 0, with an MOE of 11. The sample size is just too small. I am sincerely not surprised that both of these counties are flagged for having high MOEs.


# Part 5: Policy Recommendations

## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary

**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.

**Executive Summary Requirements:**
1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?
2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?
4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?

**Executive Summary:**

Some systematic patterns across all analyses is that the minority population is immensely small compared to the overwhelming majority of 90% white. The MOE has been consistently higher, which has led to some tracts within both counties to have a population estimate of 0, indicating a small sample size.

Both the black and LatinX communities face algorithmic biased simply because their population is so small, meaning there is likely to be a greater margin of error. 

## 6.3 Specific Recommendations

**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.

```{r recommendations-data}
# Create a summary table using your county reliability data
# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category
sum_table = selected_counties %>%
  select(
    county_name = county_data_2022_clean,
    med_inc = med_household_incomeE,
    moe_pct = med_income_moe_pct,
    conf_interval = med_income_confi
  ) %>%
  

  mutate(
    recs = case_when(
      moe_pct < 5 ~ "Safe for algorithmic decisions",
      moe_pct < 10 ~ "Use with caution - monitor outcomes",
      TRUE ~ "Requires manual review or additional data"
    )
  )
# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():
# - High Confidence: "Safe for algorithmic decisions"
# - Moderate Confidence: "Use with caution - monitor outcomes"  
# - Low Confidence: "Requires manual review or additional data"
kable(sum_table,
      caption = "**Algorithm Recommendations**",
      col.names = c("County", "Median Income", "MOE (%)", "Confidence Interval", "Recommendation"),
      digits = 2,
      align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "r"),
      
)
# Format as a professional table with kable()
```

**Key Recommendations:**

**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.

1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** [List counties with high confidence data and explain why they're appropriate]

2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [List counties with moderate confidence data and describe what kind of monitoring would be needed]

3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]

## Questions for Further Investigation

[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]
