The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:\n\n```\n- text: Assignments\n  menu:\n    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd\n      text: \"Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration\"\n```\nIf there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n# Set your Census API key\ncensus_api_key(\"eeb46a4e68d059982c2b048f843063e19bc4c294\")\n# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state\nmy_state <- \"MI\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **[Michigan]** for this analysis because: I explicitly did not select Pennsylvania, as I am a PA resident and wish to play with other census data.

The MOE has been consistently higher, which has led to some tracts within both counties to have a population estimate of 0, indicating a small sample size.\n\nBoth the black and LatinX communities face algorithmic biased simply because their population is so small, meaning there is likely to be a greater margin of error. \n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nsum_table = selected_counties %>%\n  select(\n    county_name = county_data_2022_clean,\n    med_inc = med_household_incomeE,\n    moe_pct = med_income_moe_pct,\n    conf_interval = med_income_confi\n  ) %>%\n  \n\n  mutate(\n    recs = case_when(\n      moe_pct < 5 ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      moe_pct < 10 ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\nkable(sum_table,\n      caption = \"**Algorithm Recommendations**\",\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Median Income\", \"MOE (%)\", \"Confidence Interval\", \"Recommendation\"),\n      digits = 2,\n      align = c(\"l\", \"c\", \"c\", \"c\", \"r\"),\n      \n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: **Algorithm Recommendations**\n\n|County      | Median Income | MOE (%) |      Confidence Interval       |                            Recommendation|\n|:-----------|:-------------:|:-------:|:------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------:|\n|Schoolcraft |     55071     |  11.49  |     Low Confidence (>10%)      | Requires manual review or additional data|\n|Gogebic     |     47913     |  9.95   | Moderate Confidence (5% - 10%) |       Use with caution - monitor outcomes|\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** [List counties with high confidence data and explain why they're appropriate]\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [List counties with moderate confidence data and describe what kind of monitoring would be needed]\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [date]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-astauf03/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Describe any decisions you made about data processing, county selection, or analytical choices that might affect reproducibility]\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
